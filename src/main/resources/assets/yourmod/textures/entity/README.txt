ENTITY TEXTURE NEEDED:

Create a 128x64 pixel PNG file named:
- bugatti_car.png

This should be a texture map for the 3D Bugatti model.
You can create a blue car texture with details like:
- Body: Blue metallic color
- Windows: Light blue/transparent
- Wheels: Black with gray rims
- Details: Headlights, grille, etc.

For now, the car will render without texture (may appear white/untextured).
